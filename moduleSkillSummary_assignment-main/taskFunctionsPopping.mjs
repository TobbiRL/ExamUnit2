/* 
In the file arrays.json there is an example of a an array that contains integers 
and possibly other arrays. If you need more test data you can get as many as you 
want from this source The task is to write a function that returns a flattened 
version of any such array structure.

NB! You might be tempted to use string manipulation, that is considered not 
solving the task. This is a jagged array of integers, not a string.

Example:

[
  435,
  2028,
  [
    [
      3047, 4910, 8146,
      7999, 1433, 7211,
      1197, 6002
    ],
    2821,
    3508
  ]
]
